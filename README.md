# **Support Platform for Underprivileged Athletes**

## **Overview**
This project is an initiative to support underprivileged athletes by providing them with resources, mentorship, sponsorships, and crowdfunding opportunities. It is a **frontend-only web application** built using **React.js** and **AI/LLM APIs** for intelligent responses. The application will also use **mock data** stored in JSON files where necessary.

The goal is to eventually compile all pages into a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router** for navigation. The API for AI integration will be provided, and we will be using a **structured output method** from the LLM to ensure consistent data formatting. The frontend components can be designed using **UIVerse.io, Tailblocks**, or similar libraries, but everything must be built as **React components** for reusability and modularity.

This project will not use JSX files. Instead, React will be imported into standard JavaScript (`.js`) files.
